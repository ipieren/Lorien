# Localization

### How Lorien handles localization

Godot has two ways to handle multiple languages right now:
- Putting all translations into one CSV file
- Gettext (.po files)

The CSV file way of doing things is fine if you work alone, but once you have multiple people working on translations you will get lot's of merge conflicts.
Gettext is more powerful and splits translations into seperate files, but i don't like the format.

However, you can add translations in code by using the TranslationServer. My localization files are simple `.txt` files. This makes translating strings really easy. The file format is very straight forward: One translation per line; then a key followed by the translation (sperated by at least one whitespace). The first key **must be** `LANGUAGE_NAME` followed by the language's name (in that same language, not in english). Here is an example for `English`:

`en.txt`:

```
LANGUAGE_NAME English

GREETING        Hello World!   
SAVE            Save   

# This is a comment

SAVE_AS         Save as..   # This is also a comment
TOOL_BRUSH      Brush Tool   

```

### How to add new translations

If you want to add more translations all you need to do is:
- Create a new translation file in `Assets/i18n/` using an external text editor
- That's it. The `.txt` file will be loaded automatically.
