# Lorien Manual v0.3.0

Drawing tablets are supported and recommended, but you can also just use Keyboard+Mouse. 

## Basic Usage
- Draw with the left mouse button (<kbd>LMB</kbd>) or with your drawing tablet's pen
- Pan/drag across the canvas with the middle mouse button (I recommend to map a button on your pen to the middle mouse button for easy navigation)
- Zoom with mouse wheel
- You can open files by dragging them into the window or by opening it via the menu (Shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>)

## Selection Tool
- With the Selection tool you can select a number of brush strokes by dragging across the screen with your <kbd>LMB</kbd> pressed. Brush strokes which are considered inside the selection recatangle will be added to the current selection. You can add more strokes to your current selection by holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging.
- You can deselect your current selection by pressing <kbd>RMB</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
- To move the selected strokes simply drag them while holding down <kbd>LMB</kbd>. If you did not move your mouse while pressing <kbd>LMB</kbd>, everything will be deselected automatically.
- Press <kbd>Delete</kbd> to delete the current selection
- Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy the current selection
